# C2.17_hackathon

Hackathon project involving the combination of different data sources into an application or game

### Requirements
- Combine at least 3 **external** resources via AJAX requests and present their information in an application
- Must be documented loosely on JSDOC standards
- Must be issue-managed via meistertask
- Should encorporate <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Google Material standards</a>

### Judging Criteria
- **Appeal** : is it visually appealing / well put together
- **Code Quality** : is the code properly formatted, are variables and functions well defined and documented
- **Presentation** : How well is it presented during the unveiling session
- **Task / Issue Management** : How well was the development process documented / controlled.  Were there well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
- **Innovative / Transformative** : Did the project do something new and exciting?  Was it bold and tried to do things that haven't been done much.  Did it combine the data sources together in a way that was more useful than either source by itself
- **Ease of Use / Understanding** : Was it easy to use the application / game, or if it was more complex, was the application or game able to provide you with tutorials or instructions that made understanding it a breeze.
